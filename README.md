# Wonky Projector
This tool is designed for artists wanting to preview images/designs on a canvas using a projector.
This technique can be very helpful for visualizing composition, checking placement and proportions and pencilling outlines before you start painting.

Setting up a projector to align perfectly with a canvas can be quite time consuming. This app let's you set the physical things up quickly, and then corrects for the wonkiness in software. Much easier!

# Guide
  1. Connect your laptop/tablet to your projector with screen mirroring.
  1. Start [the app](https://wonky-projector.netlify.app/app/), and preferably set it to fullscreen.
  1. Select the 'Projector' layer to show the checkerboard.
  1. Enter the size of your canvas in the toolbar, it doesn't matter if you use inches, mm or miles, the app just needs to know the aspect ratio.
  1. Line up your projector and canvas so that the canvas is completely covered by the checkerboard. For best results try not to have too much border though.
  1. Drag the four corner handles in the app so they align with the four corners on the canvas. Don't worry if things look strange while you do this, once the fourth corner is in place it should look great.
  1. Open an image and use the toolbar controls to position / scale / rotate it.
